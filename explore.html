    <img src="l.jpg" alt="Luna Lovegood">
    <div>
        <h2>ü¶ã Luna Lovegood</h2>
        <p>Luna is often underestimated, but without her, Voldemort might have actually won. She helped Harry many times, especially when searching for the Horcrux hidden at Hogwarts. She's dreamy, kind, and always herself, no matter what others think.</p>
        <p><strong> She's brave in her own quiet way and sees the world differently.</p></strong>

        <h2>‚ö° Harry Potter</h2>
        <p>People often think Harry wanted to be the center of attention, but in reality, he was just a boy who had to face a terrifying destiny. While powerful adult wizards couldn't defeat Voldemort, he stood up and fought.</p>
        <p><strong> He suffered a lot, yet kept fighting. His emotions sometimes ruled him, but that made him real.</p></strong>
    </div>
    </section>
    <section class="character">
    <img src="V.webp" alt="Lord Voldemort">
    <div>
        <h2>üêç Lord Voldemort</h2>
        <p>To be honest, I think the author was unfair to Voldemort, he was <em>too</em> powerful and clever to be beaten by a bunch of kids. Yes, evil must lose in stories, but think about what he did: killed without mercy, used the darkest magic, split his soul into seven pieces. Terrifying!</p>
        <p><strong> Not just his cruelty, but the strategic genius behind it.</p></strong>
    </div>
    </section>
    <section class="character reverse">
    <img src="F.jpg" alt="Fred and George Weasley">
    <div>
        <h2>üé≠ Fred & George Weasley</h2>
        <p>The funniest duo in the wizarding world! Always full of energy, laughter, and brilliant mischief. Even in dark times, they managed to bring smiles and, let's be honest, were always plotting something hilarious.</p>
        <p><strong> They never let anything stop them (not even war) from dreaming big (and making money!).</p></strong>
    </div>
    </section>
    <section class="character">
    <img src="SN.jpg" alt="Severus Snape">
    <div>
        <h2>‚ö´ Professor Severus Snape</h2>
        <p>The mysterious man with a broken heart. Every time he saw Harry, he was reminded of Lily. He seemed harsh, but deep down, he was Dumbledore's most loyal ally and the true hero no one saw coming.</p>
        <p><strong> He was cold outside, but burning with love and regret inside.</p></strong>
    </div>
    </section>
    <section class="character reverse">
    <img src="HA.jpg" alt="Rubeus Hagrid">
    <div>
        <h2>üêª Rubeus Hagrid</h2>
        <p>Hagrid reminds me of myself, kind, clumsy, and always accidentally saying too much! Despite being a giant, he had the biggest heart in the series.</p>
        <p><strong> He's sweet, loyal, and loves magical creatures more than most people love humans.</p></strong>

    <h1> Favourite Scene</h1>
    <div class="scene-card">
    <h2 class="scene-title">"Piertotum Locomotor"</h2>
    <div class="video-wrapper">

            <source src="Professor McGonagall Protects Hogwarts _ Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Pt. 2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        </video>
    </div>
    <p class="scene-description">
        This scene marks the "true beginning of the final battle". The moment Professor McGonagall casts "Piertotum Locomotor" to awaken the castle's stone knights is beyond epic!<br><br>
        Seeing "all the professors working together", protecting Hogwarts, and preparing it for war was a turning point. It gave chills, the school was no longer just a place of learning, but a fortress ready to fight back.<br><br>
        And let's not forget McGonagall's iconic moment: "I've always wanted to use that spell."üò≠ 
        <br>That line was pure gold. 'Queen energy.üëë'
    </p>

<section class="peak-moment">
    <div class="scene-card">
    <h2 class="scene-title"> After all this time? <span>Always.</span></h2>
    <div class="video-wrapper">
        <video controls>
        <source src="After all this time_ Always..mp4" type="video/mp4">
        </video>
    </div>
    <p class="scene-description">
        This scene is  one of the most emotional and powerful moments in the entire Harry Potter series.  
        The revelation that Snape loved Lily all along (even after all those years) hit so hard. üò¢  
        <br><br>
        It was one of the most powerful and shocking moments in the entire story, the twist that Harry himself was the final Horcrux completely blew my mind.
    </p>
    </div>
    <section class="peak-moment">
        <div class="scene-card">
    <h2 class="scene-title"> "The boy who lived... come to die."</h2>
    <div class="video-wrapper">
        <video controls>
            <source src="_The Boy Who Lived Has Come To Die_ _ Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Pt. 2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        </video>
    </div>
    <p class="scene-description">
        Voldemort's chilling voice as he casts <strong>Avada Kedavra!</strong> sent shivers down our spines.  
        The moment Harry willingly walks into the forest, ready to sacrifice himself, is one of the most heart-wrenching and heroic scenes in the entire saga.  
        <br><br>
        His quiet question to Sirius <em>"Does it hurt? Dying?"</em>, and the gentle response:  
        <em>"Quicker than falling asleep."</em>  
        Its so simple, yet so powerful.  
        <br><br>
        From this moment, you could feel the weight of destiny, death, and love all coming together. Pure goosebumps.
